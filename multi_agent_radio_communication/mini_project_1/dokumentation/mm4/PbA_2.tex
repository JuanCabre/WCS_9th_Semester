\subsection{Question 2}
\textit{The user and interferer are now replaced by angular distribution of: Cs($\Phi$)= 1 within 80 to 100 deg. , 0 outside and Is($\Phi$)=3/4 within 54 to 67 deg., 0 outside}

\subsubsection{a) what is the peak to null depth for the measured response of the user compared to max and sidelobe}

To answer this question we need to find the effective 

\subsubsection{b) What is the Cs/Is of the measured responses}

\subsubsection{c) what direction will the response function be centered at if performing a sweep (radar scan) with the antenna on the user and on the interferer?}
