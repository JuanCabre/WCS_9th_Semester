\section{Problem A - Uni directional : invariance1} \label{sec:mm4_PbA}

\subsection{Question 1}
\textit{Consider an antenna with power pattern $a=a1+a2$ with $a1=sin(\Phi).^{30}$ from 53 to 128 deg. and $a2=0.25*cos(\Phi - \frac{\pi}{4}).^{80}$ from 24 to 66 deg, zero else where}

\subsubsection{a) what is the approx. peak to null depth compared to main and side lobe}


\subsubsection{b) Now an user Co is positioned at 90 deg with 0dB and an interfere Io at 60 deg with -6dB. What is the approx. Co/Io?}
