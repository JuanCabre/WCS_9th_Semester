\section{Problem A - Uni directional : invariance1} \label{sec:mm4_PbA}

\subsection{1}
\textit{Consider an antenna with power pattern a=a1+a2 with a1=sin(ϕ).^30 from 53 to 128 deg. and a2=0.25*cos(ϕ-π/4).^80; from 24 to 66 deg, zero else where}

\subsubsection{a) what is the approx. peak to null depth compared to main and side lobe}


\subsubsection{b) Now an user Co is positioned at 90 deg with 0dB and an interfere Io at 60 deg with -6dB. What is the approx. Co/Io?}


\subsection{2}
\textit{The user and interferer are now replaced by angular distribution of: Cs(ϕ)= 1 within 80 to100 deg. , 0 outside and Is(ϕ)=3/4 within 54 to 67 deg., 0 outside}

\subsubsection{a) what is the peak to null depth for the measured response of the user compared to max and sidelobe}


\subsubsection{b) What is the Cs/Is of the measured responses}

\subsubsection{c) what direction will the response function be centered at if performing a sweep (radar scan) with the antenna on the user and on the interferer?}
