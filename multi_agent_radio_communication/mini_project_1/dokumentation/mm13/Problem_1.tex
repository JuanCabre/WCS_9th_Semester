\section{Problem 1 - Data transfer}
\textit{Imaging a new 'huge' memory tag 64kb (or 1Mb?) is used to store personal ID/images (like for passport etc). Is it realistic in a pedestrian set up to perform an 'on the fly' ID retrieval in a automated fashion. I.e. how long time does retrieval take (what interrogator-transponder communication is needed, what duplex form do you consider).. vs typical displacement of a pedestrian in same period of time. Start using Gen1 tag characteristics.. then if need for changes, what sort of tag characteristics would you like? .. where would you look for them/find them?}\\

SOMETHING...
