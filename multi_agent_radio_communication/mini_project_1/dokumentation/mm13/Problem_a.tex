\section{Problem A}
\textit{Anti collision - Binary Tree Search exercise (maybe instead of 'live students' -> Matlab simulation w more tags}\\

\textit{Each student in the group should first get his/her own ID[1], by substituting the first 4 letters in his or her last name by two bits (e.g. ):}\texttt{POUS = 10101010 = AAhex}.\\

\texttt{A, B, C, D, E, F, G} \\

\texttt{00} \\

\texttt{H, I, J, K, L, M, N }\\

\texttt{01 }\\

\texttt{O, P, Q, R, S, T, U} \\

\texttt{10} \\

\texttt{V, W, X, Y,Z, blank, other} \\

\texttt{11 }\\

\textit{Each time a request is sent[2] with an ID parameter, raise your hand if your ID is lower or equal to the parameter.}\\

\textit{How many cycles did it take to identify all unique ID's? (write down the execution results of each step in the process)}\\
