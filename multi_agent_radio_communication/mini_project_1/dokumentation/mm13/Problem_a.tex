\section{Problem A}
\textit{Anti collision - Binary Tree Search exercise (maybe instead of 'live students' -> Matlab simulation w more tags}\\

\textit{Each student in the group should first get his/her own ID[1], by substituting the first 4 letters in his or her last name by two bits (e.g. ):}\texttt{POUS = 10101010 = AAhex}.\\

\texttt{A, B, C, D, E, F, G} \\

\texttt{00} \\

\texttt{H, I, J, K, L, M, N }\\

\texttt{01 }\\

\texttt{O, P, Q, R, S, T, U} \\

\texttt{10} \\

\texttt{V, W, X, Y,Z, blank, other} \\

\texttt{11 }\\

\textit{Each time a request is sent[2] with an ID parameter, raise your hand if your ID is lower or equal to the parameter.}\\

\textit{How many cycles did it take to identify all unique ID's? (write down the execution results of each step in the process)}\\

The ID from the names

First the reader sends 0xFF and get responses from everyone to identify where the problems lays. The response will sum up so if everyone answer with 0 the sum will be 0, if everyone 1 it will be 1, and everything in between will be set to X. \\

\begin{description}
 \item [Step 1] From the answer set the first unknown equal 0, get maximum half in response
 \item [Step 2] Further reduce setting next unknown equal 0
 \item [Step 3] From answer we know we have two tags (Djam and Anders) tell them to be quiet.
 \item [Step 4] Found one (Fuentes) tell to be quiet.
 \item [Step 5] Begin from step one 
 \item [Step 6] reduce again 
 \item [Step 7] Found one (Maria) tell to be quiet.
 \item [Step 8] Found one (Jesper) tell to be quiet.
 \item [Step 9] Found last one (Johannes) tell to be quiet.
