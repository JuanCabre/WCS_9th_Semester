\section{Bidirectional Cross}
\textit{An elementary topology where network coding can provide interesting benefits is the bidirectional cross, where we distinguish between three cases:}\\

  \label{fig:Bidirectional_Cross}
\end{figure}

\textit{Specifically, the cases are (a) pure relaying, where packets are not combined, (b) network coding, where two packets are combined, and (c) network coding with overhearing, where the relay combines four packets.}


\subsection{Exercise 3: Activities.}
\textit{Give the activities for each node in the topology for cases (a), (b), and (c). The possible activities for each node are idle, receive, and send. The following tables are intended as a help to construct the respective activity plots.}\\

\subsection{Exercise 2: Throughput With Network Coding}
\textit{Repeat the steps of the previous question but using inter-session network coding at the relay. How many regions of operations are there and why?}

\subsubsection{(a) Pure Relaying}

\subsection{Exercise 4: Throughput}
\textit{Give the total throughput for the three cases (a), (b), and (c), including the plot and the analytical expressions}\\
\begin{pitemize}
\item For the case (a) the throughput is the $100 \%$ of the load ($50 \%$) because all the node receiving the packets from the relay R. \\In the case where the load is $80 \%$ the throughput is $25 \%$ of the $80 \%$ because only one note receive the packet.
\item For the case (b) with a load of $66\%$ the throughput is $100 \%$ of the $66\%$ because the relay in two operations forward the packet to the all nodes. \\ In the case where the load is $80 \%$ the throughput of the this specific load is $50 \%$ because only two receiving the packet.
\item For the case (c) the throughput is the $100 \%$ of the load because all nodes receiving the package. 
\end{pitemize}
