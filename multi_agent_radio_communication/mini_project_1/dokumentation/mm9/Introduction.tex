This mini-module covers the fundamentals of network coding with an emphasis on its application to wireless networks. The mini-module will provide intuition behind network coding's potential to achieve higher throughput, reduced energy consumption, and less overall delay. We use the classical butterfly network as a starting point, but then study three different applications of network coding in wireless networks. First, we study mechanisms with minimal coding, e.g., COPE. Second, we study random linear network coding (RLNC). Practical challenges of deploying these techniques are illustrated through concrete examples and exercises.
