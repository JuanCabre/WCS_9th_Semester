This mini-module provides an introduction to cooperation in wireless networks. The lecture motivates the use of cooperation due to application and device requirements. In particular, the importance of energy consumption in mobile wireless nodes is emphasized and put in the context of current and future trends for data and application services. We use examples of cooperation drawn from nature to illustrate and derive key intuition and then apply it in the design of cooperative systems.
