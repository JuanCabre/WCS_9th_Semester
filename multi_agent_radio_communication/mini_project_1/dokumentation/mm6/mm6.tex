This mini module is an introduction to the principal of \textit{Cognitive Radio}. The idea behind the concept is to distribute  the access to the medium/spectrum in a dynamic way. \\

\textit{From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia}\\
A cognitive radio is an intelligent radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically. Its transceiver is designed to use the best wireless channels in its vicinity. Such a radio automatically detects available channels in wireless spectrum, then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications in a given spectrum band at one location. This process is a form of dynamic spectrum management.

\section{Choice of Sharing Strategy}
In order to be able to access the spectrum in a dynamic way different strategies can be used
