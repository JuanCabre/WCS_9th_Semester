\section{Problem A}
\textit{You are to make a total cost of ownership (TCO) financial estimate to determine the direct and indirect costs of an indoor wireless system over an analysis period of 5 years.}\\

\textit{The system consists initially of 5 enterprise Femto base stations at a price tag of 500 Euros each and depreciation period of 7 years; the price erosion of the base station equipment is 6\% per year. In addition to the Femto base stations the system comprises a Femto gateway controller capable of handling up to 10 base stations; the gateway has a price tag of 50 Euros per connected base station and a depreciation period of 10 years. The base stations are connected to the gateway over an already existing Gigabit Ethernet network. The traffic from the gateway to the external network (backhaul) is carried over a leased fibre-optic connection, at a cost of 400 Euros per month. The installation cost per new Femto is 300 Euros and the annual service cost amounts to 20\% of the equipment cost; installation, service and leasing costs increase by 2\% annually.}\\

SOMETHING...\\

\textit{After 3 years, an additional 3 Femto base stations, with the same depreciation period of 7 years, are installed in the system.}\\

SOMETHING...\\

\textit{Detail the contributions to CAPEX, IMPEX and OPEX and calculate the TCO of this indoor wireless solution assuming a (risk and inflation compensated) interest rate of 5\%.}\\
