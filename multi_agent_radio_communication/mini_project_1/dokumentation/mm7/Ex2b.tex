\textit{Assuming that all parameters except the processing $G$ are fixed, arbitrary value of $K$, and the minimal required SINR by each user is equal to $\beta$, find the minimal $G$ that will enable each user to achieve the minimal required SINR.}\\

In this exercise the aim is to minimize G. In order to do this we start with the equation for the SINR, also shown in \equref{eq:SINRmm7EX2}, and equivalent that to $\beta$:
\begin{flalign}
&& \frac{G\,Q_k}{\sum\limits_{n\neq k}Q_n+N_0 W} &= \beta & \label{eq:SINRmm7EX2_b}
\end{flalign} 

For a given value of $Q$ here denoted $Q_w$ the resulting $SINR_W$ is equivalent to $\beta$. Using this we can rewrite \equref{eq:SINRmm7EX2_b} to an expression for G. This will result in the following:
\begin{flalign}
&& G &= \frac{\beta\left(\sum\limits_{n\neq k}Q_n+N_0 W \right)}{Q_W} & 
\end{flalign}
