\section{Problem A}
\textit{Calculate the delay spread for this channel model using the average power delay profile.}\\

In \tref{tab:1_intro}, the power amplitudes corresponding to the given tap delays are given. Using a script developed in the last semesters course \textit{Wireless Systems Performance} the delay spread is then calculated. The script first derives the probability density function and from that the delay spread, which is the standard deviation of the power delay profile. 

\code{language=Matlab,caption = Delay Spread Calculation,label=cl:spread,linerange={1-14},firstnumber=1}{code/mm1/spread.m}

The delay spread is
\begin{flalign}
&& \sigma_{\text{ds}} =& \SI{1.026}{\micro\second} &
\end{flalign}
