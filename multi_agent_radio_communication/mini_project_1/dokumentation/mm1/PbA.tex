\section{Problem A}
\textit{Calculate the delay spread for this channel model using the average power delay profile.}

In \tref{tab:1_intro}, the power amplitudes corresponding to the given tap delays are given. Using a script developed in the last semesters course Wireless Systems Performance the delay spread is then calculated.
