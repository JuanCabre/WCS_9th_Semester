\section{Problem D}
\textit{Generate a few more channel realizations that follow the same power delay profile and let them be independent of the first set of channel realizations. Assume that these correspond to the channel impulse response from another transmit antenna.}

This was an easy task that was performed in a few lines in Matlab.
