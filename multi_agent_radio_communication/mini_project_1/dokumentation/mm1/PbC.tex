\section{Problem C}
\textit{For each of the channel realizations generated in (B) perform time reversal from a single antenna. Store the new equivalent channel impulse responses, with and without power normalization and the transmitter. Calculate the new power delay profile and from that the delay spread. How does it compare to the delay spread calculated in (B)?}
