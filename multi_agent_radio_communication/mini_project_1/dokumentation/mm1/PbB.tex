\section{Problem B}
\textit{Use the Matlab random number generator to generate several (how many is 'several'?) realizations of the channel (one realization = one set of complex values, each one corresponding to the complex tap gain of the taps). Store these values. Calculate the average power delay profile based on these realization, and from that find the delay spread. Is it in good agreement with the result from (A)?}
