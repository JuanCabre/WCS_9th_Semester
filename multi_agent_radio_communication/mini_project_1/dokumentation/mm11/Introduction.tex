This mini-module provides an analysis of energy and rate advantages to cooperation in wireless networks. The lecture motivates the potential gains on the multiple and heterogeneous interfaces available in mobile devices, including cellular connectivity and short-range interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi). The lecture focuses on cooperation mechanisms at different layers of the protocol stack, ranging from PHY layer and link cooperation techniques, to MAC, network, and application layer approaches. The gains are illustrated using analytical examples and measurements from practical deployments.
