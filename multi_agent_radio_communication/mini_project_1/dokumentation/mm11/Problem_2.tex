\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Repeat problem 1 parts a)-d) considering the same topology, consider now that there is a cost for being idle, $E_{idle}$, and a cost for XOR'ing the data packets, $E_{XOR}$. How large would $E_{XOR}$ (as a function of the other energy terms) have to be for the network coding to be impractical in this setting.}\\

Most of this problem is answered and shown in gray color in problem 1.\\

NC is impractical when, according to the metric:
\begin{pitemize}
\item EperTpackets: $E_{E_{x}}\geq 4E_{i}+\frac{3}{5}E_{t}-\frac{8}{5}E_{r}$
\item EperTpackets pTR: $E_{E_{x}}\geq 3E_{t}-E_{r}+\frac{43}{4}E_{i}$
\end{pitemize}
