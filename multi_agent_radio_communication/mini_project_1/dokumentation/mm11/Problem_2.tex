\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Repeat problem 1 parts a)-d) considering the same topology, consider now that there is a cost for being idel, $E_{idel}$, and a cost for XOR'ing the data packets, $E_{XOR}$. How large would $E_{XOR}$ (as a function of the other energy terms) have to be for the network coding to be impractical in this setting.}\\
