\section{Problem 1}
\textit{Using the overhearing cross topology for NC, consider that transmission of a packet has a cost of $E_t$ and reception of a packet a cost of $E_r$. Assume initially no losses in the links.}

\subsection{a) - Calculate the total energy used to deliver one packet from each }





\subsection{b) - x }





\subsection{c) - x }






\subsection{d) - x }






\subsection{e) - x }
