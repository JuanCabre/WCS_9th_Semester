\section{Problem C}
\textit{REDUCING MAXIMUM PATH LOSS. For the same given coverage area, compare the maximum path loss of a single antenna system, $PL_{max}^1$, to the maximum path loss of an M-antenna distributed system, $PL_{max}^M$, and express the reduction in the dynamic range. Define path loss at the cell boundary, $d_c$, of the single-antenna system (as in the boxed expression above). State the implications of the relation.}

\begin{flalign}
&& PL_{max} \equiv & \frac{P_R}{P_{d_c}} = C\left(\frac{A_c}{\pi}\right)^{\sfrac{\gamma}{2}} & \label{eq:MaximumPathLoss}
\end{flalign}
