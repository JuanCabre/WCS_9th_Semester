\section{Problem C}
\textit{REDUCING MAXIMUM PATH LOSS. For the same given coverage area, compare the maximum path loss of a single antenna system, $PL_{max^1}$, to the maximum path loss of an M-antenna distributed system, $PL_{max^M}$, and express the reduction in the dynamic range. Define path loss at the cell boundary, $d_c$, of the single-antenna system (as in the boxed expression above). State the implications of the relation.}\\

First the relation between the maximum path-loss for one and M antennas is described by \equref{eq:probc1} from problem B.\\

The maximum path-loss is form this exercise given by:
\begin{flalign}
&& PL_{max} \equiv & \frac{P_R}{P_{d_c}} = C\left(\frac{A_c}{\pi}\right)^{\sfrac{\gamma}{2}} & \label{eq:MaximumPathLoss}
\end{flalign}  

where $PL_{max}$ is the maximum pathloss, $P_R$ is the reference power which is equivalent to the transmitted power and $P_{d_c}$ is the minimum acceptable downlink power level at the cell boundary which is at the distance $d_c$ from the cell center (Radius of coverage area). $A_c$ is the coverage area of the cell and $\gamma$ is the pathloss exponent. C is a scaling constant. \\

From the hint given in the exercise we can derive the following:
\begin{flalign}
&& \frac{PL_{max}^M}{PL_{max}^1}  =& \frac{PL_{max}^1 \, M^{\frac{-\gamma}{2}}}{PL_{max}^1} = M^{\frac{-\gamma}{2}} & \label{eq:hintTBS} 
\end{flalign}
This relation between the two is however already shown in problem B.\\

This indicate that the higher the path-loss is the more advantages it is to use a distributed system.
