\section{Problem D}
\textit{ UPLINK $C/I$ (NOISE INGRESS). For the same given coverage area, compare the minimum $C/I$ of a single 
antenna system, $(C/I)^1$, to the minimum $C/I$ of an M-antenna distributed system, $(C/I)^M$, assuming a "distant 
interferer" received at power level I. Derive the expression for $(C/I)^M$ for the case with transmit power 
reduction at the portable (see (b)).}

Noise ingress in the leaking in of a signal when electrical energy enters a coaxial environment.
