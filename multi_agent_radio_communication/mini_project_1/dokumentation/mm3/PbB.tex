\section{Problem B}

\textit{MINIMISING RADIATED POWER. For the same given coverage area, compare the radiated power (interference) of a single antenna system, $P_{tx}^1$, to the total radiated power of an M-antenna distributed system, $P_{tx}^M$, for both the network (downlink) and the portable side (uplink). State the implications of the relation.}

In the "lemma" we need to consider these two cases:

\textbf{Single Antenna System}

As there is only one antenna, the total area covered ($A_{T}$) is the area covered for the antenna.

\begin{equation}
A_{T} = \pi \cdot d_{c1}^{2}
\end{equation}

For that area the path loss has the expression:

%\begin{flalign}
%&& PL_{max} &= \frac{P_{R}}{P_{d_{C}}} &
%\end{flalign}
