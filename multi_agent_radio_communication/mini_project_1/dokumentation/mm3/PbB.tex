\section{Problem B}

\textit{MINIMISING RADIATED POWER. For the same given coverage area, compare the radiated power (interference) of a single antenna system, $P_{tx}^1$, to the total radiated power of an M-antenna distributed system, $P_{tx}^M$, for both the network (downlink) and the portable side (uplink). State the implications of the relation.}

In the "lemma" we need to consider these two cases: Single Antenna System and M Antenna System.
For the case of Single Antenna System, as there is only one antenna, the total area covered ($A_{c}$) is the area covered for the antenna.

\begin{flalign}
&& A_{c} =& \pi \cdot d_{c}^{2} &
\end{flalign}

For that area the path loss has the expression:

\begin{flalign}
&& PL_{max} =& \dfrac{P_{R}}{P_{d_{c}}}=c\left(\dfrac{A_c}{\pi}\right)  ^{\frac{\varphi}{2}}  &
\end{flalign}

In order to compute the tranmitted power let's take in account the espression of the cover area for the M Antenna System:
\begin{flalign}
&& A_{c_m} =& M \cdot \pi \cdot d_{c_m}^{2} &
\end{flalign}
Where M is the number of the antenna and $d_{c_m}$ is the ray for each of Mth antenna.
By comparing $A_{c}$ and $ A_{c_m}$  it can be find the relationship between the ray for a Single Antenna System $d_{c}$ and M Antenna System $d_{c_m}$. 
\begin{flalign}
&& A_{c}=& A_{c_m} &\\
&& \pi\cdot d_{c}=& M \cdot \pi \cdot d_{c_m} &
\end{flalign}
