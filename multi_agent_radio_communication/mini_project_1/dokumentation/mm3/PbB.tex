\section{Problem B}

\textit{MINIMISING RADIATED POWER. For the same given coverage area, compare the radiated power (interference) of a single antenna system, $P_{tx}^1$, to the total radiated power of an M-antenna distributed system, $P_{tx}^M$, for both the network (downlink) and the portable side (uplink). State the implications of the relation.}
