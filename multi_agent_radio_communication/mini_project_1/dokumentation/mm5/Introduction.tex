This lecture consists of three parts. It first discusses the overall problem of multi-user communication over a shared medium. This part will review the main ideas of the MAC protocols (scheduled vs. random) defined under the simple communication model. The second part will discuss the concept of layering as a specific way to implement a particular portico. Finally, the third part will contain three examples on cross-layered designs associated with the shared wireless medium.
