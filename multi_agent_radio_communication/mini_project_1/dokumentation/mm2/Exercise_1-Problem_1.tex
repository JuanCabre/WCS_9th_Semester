\section{Exercise 1 - Problem 1}
\textit{ANALYTICAL: Select one of the code examples shown in class and show that they can achieve full diversity order.}\\

The code chosen was the one with three antennas and four symbols from the slides.\\

The first required step was to find the matrix E
\begin{flalign}
 && E =& S \cdot S^H & \label{eq:1_matrixE}
\end{flalign}

Once that matrix was found, the objective was to check if the rank was 3 (since there were 3 antennas); if this property was fulfilled, we could then say that the code achieved full diversity.\\

If the matrix E also resulted diagonal then this would mean that the evaluated code is also orthogonal.\\

The matrix E resulted to be (after correcting the error in the slide):
\begin{flalign}
 && E =& S \cdot S^H & \label{eq:1_matrixE}
\end{flalign}
