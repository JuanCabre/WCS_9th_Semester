\section{Problem A}
\textit{To waterfill or not?}

\textit{Consider a 2x2 MIMO channel with ZMCSCG elements with unit variance. Develop your code for a square MIMO system of arbitrary number of antennas (and not just 2) since you will need it later in the problem. How does channel knowledge affect the Ergodic Capacity and the 10 percent Outage Capacity at low and high SNR values.} \\

\textit{Now increase the number of antennas to 4, 6 and 8 (remember the system is still MxM). How does channel knowledge affect ergodic capacity at 10 dB SNR with an increase in the number of antennas.}

ZMCSCG stands for Zero-Mean Circulant Symmetric Complex Gaussian.
