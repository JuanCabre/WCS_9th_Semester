\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Change sketch to another arch type dual directional channel (what types are there?)}\\

could implement partial circles, or cluster of scatters on a cirlce.

\subsection{a)}
\textit{Where/how do you implement this change in the m-script?}\\



\subsection{b)}
\textit{What changes do you see wrt correlation, eigen distribution etc?}\\

Missing, as the engine(s) of the code was not adapted to fully work in these scenarios.
