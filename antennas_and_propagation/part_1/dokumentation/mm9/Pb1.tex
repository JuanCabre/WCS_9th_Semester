\section{Problem 1}
\textit{Look at the code and try to sketch (graphically) the scattering layout it is implementing.}\\

The scattering layout being implemented is two sets of scatterers, each set form a ring around an array of 4 antennas (4 antennas transmitting and 4 receiving in total). The code allows the user to control the number of scatterers around the arrays of antennas; the distance between the center of the rings; the distance traveled by the arrays of antennas. An example is shown in figure \figref{fig:2D_setup1}.

\subsection{a)}
\textit{Find link correlations (complex, envelope or power. What do you choose/why?)}\\

The correlation of envelope and power due to it is easy to treat and in most cases it is sufficient

\subsection{b)}
\textit{Look at eigen distribution, what is seen?}\\



\subsection{c)}
\textit{What is envelope distribution of link signals (in dB , why?)? (look at 10\% level vs mean, why?)}\\

Sometimes Rayleigh, sometimes Rayleigh-Rayleigh BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING THIS!!! WHYYY 

\subsection{d)}
\textit{Doppler spectrum of a link signal looks like??}\\

The Doppler spectrum of a link signal has the classical bathtub shape when only one of the antennas array is moving; this can be seen in \figref{fig:singledopp}. When both antennas arrays are moving, the shape of the observed Doppler spectrum is the ``tent shape'' as the studied Double-Doppler effect. This can be seen in \figref{fig:dualdopp}

\subsection{e)}
\textit{Identify channel type (based on sketch and/or eigen distribution etc)}\\

Something Nice.
