\section{Problem 1}
\textit{Look at the code and try to sketch (graphically) the scattering layout it is implementing.}\\

Something Nice. 


\subsection{a)}
\textit{Find link correlations (complex, envelope or powerâ€¦what do you choose/why?)}\\

Something Nice. 

\subsection{b)}
\textit{Look at eigen distribution, what is seen?}\\

Something Nice. 

\subsection{c)}
\textit{What is envelope distribution of link signals (in dB , why?)? (look at 10\% level vs mean, why?)}\\

Something Nice. 

\subsection{d)}
\textit{Doppler spectrum of a link signal looks like??}\\

Something Nice. 

\subsection{e)}
\textit{Identify channel type (based on sketch and/or eigen distribution etc)}\\
