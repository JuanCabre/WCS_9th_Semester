\section{Problem 1}
\textit{Consider a street with infinite sides and a ground. For simplicity assume that both antennas are in the middle of the street. Apply a simple model using image theory with N reflections from the sides using a negative reflection coefficient.}\\

\textit{For positions along the street, find the:}

\textit{
\begin{pitemize}
\item field strength in dB without considering the antenna gains . What is the general trend (path loss) and fine structure (fading) vs range - and how does it change when different number of reflections are taken into account
\item infinite bandwidth impulse response- how does it vary with range and max number of reflections
\end{pitemize}
}

The problem sketch is found in \figref{fig:sketch_mm10}.

\end{figure}
In this scenario image theory is applied with N reflections using a negative reflection coefficient. Its negative value means that the reflected wave is shifted in phase by \SI{180}{\degree} ($\pi$). The antenna heights are denoted by $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ and $a$ represents the distance between the walls.

Using this scenario, the field strength is expressed in dB and the antenna gains are not considered. The path loss and field strength are represented as a function of distance in \figref{fig:field_pathloss}.

This has been obtaint through the formulation below: 
\code{language=Matlab, caption = Field strength in dB, label=cl:Field strength in dB,linerange={28-40},firstnumber=1}{code/mm10/exercise_A_MM10.m} 
where N is the number of reflection,$ R_{w}$ is the reflection coefficient for the wall and $R_{g}$ is the reflection coefficient for the ground, Floss is the free space pathloss.

\begin{pitemize}
\item infinite bandwidth impulse response- how does it vary with range and max number of reflections
\end{pitemize}
}

In this section we are going to build the impulse response in function of the delay for different distances: $dref_1$=100 and $dref_2$= 200. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{Impulse_Response.eps}

  \label{fig:Impulse_Response}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{Impulse_Response_Delay_norm.eps}
  \caption{Impulse response in function of the delay with the first tap received}
  \label{fig:Impulse_Response_Delay_norm}
\end{figure}

The figures above represent the impulse response for a distance between the antennas of 100 and 200 metres with a blue and red plot respectively. The \figref{fig:Impulse_Response} is represented in function of the total delay since the signal was transmitted. As it can be observed, the total delay for the first trace upcoming to the receiver is higher for a longer distance between the antennas. This result is completely logical given the fact that the ray have to go through a longer way. 
On the other hand, in \figref{fig:Impulse_Response_Delay_norm} we can observe the impulse response in function of the delay to the first tap received. In this case is shown that for a longer distance between the antennas the delay for the different paths is shorter. That's caused by the fact that for a longer distance the angle of the reflected rays is smaller and the effective length difference between the direct trace and the rest is shorter.
