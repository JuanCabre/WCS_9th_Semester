\section{Problem 1}
\textit{Consider a street with infinite sides and a ground. For simplicity assume that both antennas are in the middle of the street. Apply a simple model using image theory with N reflections from the sides using a negative reflection coefficient.}\\

The problem sketch is found in figure. In this scenario we vary the
