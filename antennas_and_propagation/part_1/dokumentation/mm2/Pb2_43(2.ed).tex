\section{Problem 2.43 (2. ed, 2.51 3. ed)}

The input reactance of an infinitesimal linear dipole of length $\frac{\lambda}{60}$ and radius $a = \frac{\lambda}{200}$ is given by
\begin{flalign}
&& X_{in} \simeq& -120 \frac{\left[ln(\ell/2a) - 1\right]}{tan(k\ell/2)}& 
\end{flalign}
Assuming the wire of the dipole is copper with a conductivity of $5.7E7 [S/m]$ determined at f = 1 GHz the 

\subsection{(a) loss resistance}

\subsection{(b) radiation resistance}

\subsection{(c) radiation efficiency}

\subsection{(d) VSWR when the antenna is connected to a 50-ohm line}

\subsection{(e) Match the antenna impedance to 50 Ohm}

\subsection{(f) Plot the SWR for the frequency, 500 MHz to 2 GHz assuming the impedance of the antenna does not
change from the impedance at 1 GHz.}

\subsection{(g) Plot the SWR for the frequency, 500 MHz to 2 GHz, with the impedance of the antenna as it changes
according to the formulas}
