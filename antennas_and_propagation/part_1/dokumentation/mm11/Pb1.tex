\section{FFT Physical Optics - Multi Screen Propagation}
\textit{Consider a 1/2-screen model setup following [2]. Use some field conditioning described in [1]. Start with diffraction past one screen and look at behaviour around grazing incidence.}\\

\noindent \textit{A start of a program exercise\_MM9\_PO.m may be found at:}\\
\texttt{http://kom.aau.dk/\~pe/education/menu/9sem/}\\
\textit{Follow the â€˜instructions'/ questions in the script and make it work and explain how/why.}\\

\noindent \textit{If you get very erratic behaviour output = typically indexing error (wrong phases response). If you get inverse order beaviour , typically indexing sequence or phase sign. So be very particular wrt indexing/phase checks.}\\
