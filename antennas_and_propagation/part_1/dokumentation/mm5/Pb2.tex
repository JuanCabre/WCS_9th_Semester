\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Problem 7.4 from chapter 7 of the Balanis - Advanced Engineering}\\

\noindent\textit{For the infinitesimal vertical magnetic dipole of Problem 7.3, simplify the expressions for the electric vector potential, and electric and magnetic fields, when the observations are made in the far field.}\\

First we will need the integral form of the magnetic vector potential from table 7-1 at page 312 in Balanis - Advanced Engineering:
\begin{flalign}
&& \mathbf{F} &= \dfrac{\varepsilon}{4\,\pi}\,\iiint_V \mathbf{M}\frac{e^{-\,j\,\beta\,R}}{R} \,dx\,dy\,dz &
\end{flalign}

Since we know have a infinitesimal dipole the magnetic moment is $I_m \cdot \mathrm{d}l$ then you can simply take fields given at 312 or see the following:
