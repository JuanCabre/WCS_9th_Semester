\section{Problem 2.4 (2.ed)}
\textit{The power radiated by a lossless antenna is \SI{10}{\watt}. The directional characteristics of the antenna are represented by the radiation intensity of:}\\
\begin{flalign}
& & U = B_0\,cos^3(\theta) & & (W/unit\, solid\, angle ) & & 0 \leq \theta \leq \dfrac{\pi}{2},\, 0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi &
\end{flalign}

\subsection{a}
\textit{Find the maximum power density (in watts per square meter) at a distance of \SI{1000}{\meter} (assume far field distance). Specify the angle where this occurs.}



\subsection{b}
\textit{Find the directive of the antenna (dimensionless and in dB)}


\subsection{c}
\textit{Find the gain of the antenna (dimensionless and in dB)}
