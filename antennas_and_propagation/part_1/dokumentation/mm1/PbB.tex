\section{Problem B}
\textit{In a communication system operating at $\SI{9}{\giga\hertz}$, the transmitted and receiving antennas are 
identical and separated by $\SI{10}{\kilo\meter}$. To meet the signal to noise ratio of the receiver the received 
power must be at least $\SI{10}{\micro\watt}$. Assume the antennas are aligned for maximum reception to 
each other including polarization and impedance matching. What should the gains of the antennas 
be when the power to the transmitting antenna is $\SI{10}{\watt}$?}\\

To solve this problem, we consider only the antenna gains and free space losses. The free space loss is dependant on the distance and the wavelength (thus the frequency), while the gains of the transmitting and receiving antenna are the same. Then, we can apply \textit{Friis Formula} for transmission and calculate the gains of the antennas.

\begin{flalign}
&& \lambda &= \dfrac{c}{f}= \dfrac{1}{30} \\
&& \dfrac{P_{Rx}}{P_{Tx}} &= G_{Tx} G_{Rx} \left(\dfrac{\lambda}{4 \pi d}\right)^2
\end{flalign}
with $G_{Tx} = G_{Rx}=:G$ and $\lambda = \dfrac{c}{f}= \dfrac{1}{30} \SI{}{\meter}$
\begin{flalign}
&& G &= \sqrt{\dfrac{P_{Rx}}{P_{Tx}}} \left(\dfrac{\lambda}{4 \pi d}\right) \\
&& &= 1200\pi \\
&&  &\approx \SI{35,8}{\decibel}
\end{flalign}
