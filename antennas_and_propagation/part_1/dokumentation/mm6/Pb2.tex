\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Using the FDTD matlab code given at the course, design a Yagi-Uda antenna that has a gain of at least 6 dBi at 850 Mhz.}\\

We followed the design proposal for a Yagi-Uda antenna originally proposed by Hidetsugu Yagi in \cite{lit:YAGI}. The specific details for a three elements is found from the standardization from the National Bureau of Standards (US) shown in \tref{tab:Yagi-jpg}.

  \label{tab:Yagi-jpg}
\end{figure}

Since the antenna should have a required gain of 6 dBi at 850 Mhz, our wavelength of interest is $\lambda = \SI{0.353}{\meter}$. Given that wavelength, since we wanted to have an accurate FDTD simulation, we set the cell size to $\SI{0.01}{\meter}$. The literature recommends to use a cell size of at least a tenth of a wavelength, with the chosen value we were sure that we were fulfilling that requirement.\\

The simulation geometry is shown in the \figref{fig:3_element_yagi-uda_geometry} and the simulation parameters are shown in \tref{tab:antenna_param}

From the radiation diagram of \figref{fig:yagi_radiation_pattern_director} we can see that the three elements Yagi-Uda antenna presents a gain of 6 dBi. These results are close to those found in a reference on-line for Yagi-Uda antennas (\figref{fig:3_element_yagi-uda}) where it is said that the gain of a 3-elements Yagi-Uda antenna is of 6.3 dBi.

For didactical purposes we tried to simulate the Yagi-Uda antenna without the director. The geometry of the simulation is shown in \figref{fig:2_element_yagi-uda_geometry}. The simulated radiation pattern is shown in \figref{fig:yagi_radiation_pattern} and it can be seen that, as it was expected, it is a less directive antenna (with a gain of 5 dBi) than the 3-elements Yagi-Uda.
