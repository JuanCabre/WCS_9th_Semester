\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Using the CST microwave studio given at the course, design a Yagi-Uda antenna that has a gain of at least 6 dBi at 850 Mhz using the General Frequency (FEM) and IE solver. Compare the results and simulation time with the results from Matlab code and method of moments code form Agilent.}\\

Something nice
