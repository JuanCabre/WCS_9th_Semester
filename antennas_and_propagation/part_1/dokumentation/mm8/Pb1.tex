\section{Problem 1}
\textit{ Using the method of moments code from Agilent ADS simulate a Yagi-Uda antenna that has a gain of at least 6 dBi at 850 Mhz.}\\

We implemented the same antenna design as implemented in CST in mm7. The designed Yagi antenna in ADS is giving a gain patten as shown in \figref{fig:3d_ADS}. The polar plot is shown in \figref{fig:ADS_pattern} and in \figref{fig:ADS_cart_pattern} the Cartesian version is also presented. Note that the plot here shows a very large gain, this is not true but a normalization issue with ADS. The gain pattern when compared CST is similar. In \figref{fig:ADS_S11} the matching (S11) is shown.
