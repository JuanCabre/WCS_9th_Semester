\section{Problem 1}
\textit{ Modify the Matlab code to have a second excitation phase delayed . Study the gain pattern of the two dipoles resonating at 850 MHz as a function of distance between the dipoles and the phase difference between their excitation. Compare the numerical results with the theoretical results from section 6.2 from Balanisâ€™ Antenna Theory second edition.}\\

Something Nice.
