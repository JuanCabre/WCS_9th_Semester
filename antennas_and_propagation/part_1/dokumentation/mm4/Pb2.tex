\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Figure 2.59 shows a polarization diversity configuration having radiation patterns as shown in figure 2.60 as a function of alpha. For alpha equal 0, pure polarization diversity is not obtained due to the problem on the Z-axis but is that the only problem? b) if you are asked to make a polarization diversity antenna for a base station (e.g. using array techniques) how should the radiation pattern look like?}
